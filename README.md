## Shiny Application for Visualizing Characteristics of Penguins

**Choice of Assignment**

This Application is part of STAT545B assignments. It involves either A. modifying the BC Liquor app or B. creating a Shiny app from scratch. I chose option B, i.e. to create a Shiny app from scratch.

**How the App functions**

The app provides an avenue to visually explore the various size relationships 
in species of penguins on 3 islands. The `palmerpenguins::penguins` dataset is used
for this purpose.
  
**The app has the following features:**

1. It gives the user the freedom to select species of interest.
2. It also provides the option to choose specific size characteristics 
   (i.e. variables) to map to the x- and y-coordinates. 
3. The user can also give the plot a custom title based on characteristics plotted.
4. There is also an option to study the penguins within a specific year. 
5. The user can select year of interest manually or by pressing the play button.
   The play can be paused at will.

**Data Source**

The penguins dataset used in the app is from:
